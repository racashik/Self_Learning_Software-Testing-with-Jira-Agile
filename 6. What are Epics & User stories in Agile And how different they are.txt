************* What is Epic *************
Epic like the feature of the software which are in high level. 
It's large enough that can be split into smaller user stories.

i.e: A software have to develop the following features
1. Develop Login Module
2. Credit Card Dashboard
3. Profile

So here has 3 Epic





************ What is User Story *************
User story is like the chunk of work in the whole Epic. 
It's the smallest unit of work in an agile framework.

i.e: We have to develop "Profile" feature but it has the following small 4 unit
1. Card holder Name
2. Card details
3. Available Balance
4. Log out button

So here has 4 User stories for the epic called "Profile"

To achieve the "Profile" epic, we need to developed the 4 User Stories



********** Structure of the Description of the User Story ***********
"As a [Person], I [Want to], [so that]"

i.e: As a client, I want to insert my email and password in the login page so that I can login.
OR: As a client, I should be able to enter my email and password in the login page so that I can login.
