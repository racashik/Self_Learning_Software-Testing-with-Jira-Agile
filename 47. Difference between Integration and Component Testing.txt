*************  Difference between Integration and Component Testing  ******************

Component testing, also known as unit testing or module testing, is a level of software 
testing that focuses on verifying the individual components or units of a system.


i.e: A website has 3 pages, Home, About Us and Contact. Testing each pages individually
called Component testing.





Integration Testing is multiple parts of a software system are tested as a group.

i.e: Contact page has a Contact Us Form where submit the Name, email and message.
Once customer fill the form and submit, those information stored in a database so here
the form is integrated with the database. Checking the information is storing to the 
database or not is the Integration testing here.
