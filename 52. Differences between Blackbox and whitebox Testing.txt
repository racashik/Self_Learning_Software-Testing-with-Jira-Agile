*************** Differences between Blackbox and whitebox Testing ********************

BlackBox Testing: Black-box testing is a type of software testing in which the tester is 
not concerned with the softwareâ€™s internal knowledge or implementation details but rather 
focuses on validating the functionality based on the provided specifications or requirements. The tester only focuses on the input and output of the software.

Black Box Testing is mostly done by software testers.
No knowledge of programming is required.

Example:
Functional Testing 
Regression Testing
Nonfunctional Testing (NFT)



WhiteBox Testing: White box testing techniques analyze the internal structures the used data 
structures, internal design, code structure, and the working of the software rather than 
just the functionality as in black box testing. It is also called glass box testing or 
clear box testing or structural testing. White Box Testing is also known as transparent 
testing or open box testing.

White Box Testing is mostly done by software developers.
It is mandatory to have knowledge of programming.

Example: 
Unit Testing
Integration Testing
Regression Testing
