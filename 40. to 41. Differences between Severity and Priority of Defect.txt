--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



**************** Differences between Severity and Priority of Defect **********************

Severity: It is the extent to which the defect can affect the software. 
Mention the impact on software. It's mention the functional issue.

Severity is categorised into 4 Class.

Critical, Major, Medium, Low


Critical: The defect indicates complete shut-down of the application, nothing can proceed further.
i.e: Shop tab not working.

Major: It is a highly severe defect and collapses the system. However, certain parts of the 
system remain functional.
i.e: Can't add few products(Iphone X) to cart.

Medium: It causes some undesirable behavior, but the application is still functional.
i.e: Navigating to checkout page without selecting any orders.

Low: It won't cause any major break-down of the application. We can fix or skip this bug also.
i.e: Cart is getting cleared on page refresh.



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Priority: Priority is defined as the order in which a defect should be fixed. 
It's mention how quickly it need to be fixed.

It can be categorized as Low, Medium, High

Usually we can't say High Severity means high Priority. 

A common interview question is, give an example of High Priority but Low Severity. 
A spelling mistake in the website's name on the main page is considered a High Priority issue.
Although it does not affect functionality and can be marked as Low Severity, 
it negatively impacts the website's reputation. Therefore, fixing it is of the highest priority.


Also can say, Any cosmetic or spelling issues which is within a paragraph or in the report.
