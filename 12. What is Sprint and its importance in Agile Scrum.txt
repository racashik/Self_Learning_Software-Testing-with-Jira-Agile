**********  What is Sprint and its importance in Agile Scrum  ************
Sprint is like a timeframe in which a team will work to accomplish specific goals.
We split Epic in to User Story and here split the whole User Story in Sprint.

i.e: There are 20 User story we have that need to finish in 60 days. 
We ca split those 20 User Story in 5 Sprint.

So each Sprint will have 12 days and have to finish 4 User Stories.


N.B: We can create "Sprint" from the Backlog menu
.


Since we put the "Story Points" to each "User Story" and each point represents 1 working day.
When will grooming the Sprint, we can organize the Sprint "Estimate" number also.

As we have seen in the avobe scenario that we will have 12 days for each/first Sprint so we will add those
"User Stories" which makes in total 12 "Estimate" point for the "Sprint". 


Once we groom the Sprint board, we can schedule the starting time and start that Sprint by clicking the "Start Sprint" Button,
and can monitor the Sprint word progress from the "Active Sprints" menu.
