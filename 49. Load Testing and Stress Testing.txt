*********** Load Testing and Stress Testing ************

Load Testing: Load testing perform to identify at which load, system is behaving.
i.e: If 1K Users access to a website how much time it takes to load, and gradually this
way check how much time takes for 10K, 100K and so on.

Definitelt when the number of users will be increased, loading time will be also increased, 
so by doing this test, tester note and report that information to the developer.




Stress Testing: Stress Testing perform to identify the "Breaking Point". At which number of
user's access the system server get crashed. 
i.e: if 10K users visit hte system at a same time, system runs well, all can et access though
it's taking slight more time to load but when 10K plus 1 visits, server gets out of service
so here can consider 10,001 is the Breaking point of the system.


By recording this Breaking point, tester report to the developer. 



The Most popular Load testing tools is "JMeter"
