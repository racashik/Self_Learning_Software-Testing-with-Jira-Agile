**********  What is Smoke/Sanity Testing How important it is in build process  *************
Smoke testing, also called build verification testing or confidence testing, 
is a software testing method that is used to determine if a new software build is ready 
for the next testing phase. This testing method determines if the most crucial functions 
of a program work but does not delve into finer details.

As a preliminary check of software, smoke testing finds basic and critical issues in 
an application before more in-depth testing is done. If a piece of software passes a 
smoke test, quality assurance (QA) teams then proceed with further testing. 
A failure means the software must be handed back to the development team.


Smoke test typically runs after every build.

It runs by the CI/CD environment like Jenkin.


Example of Smoke/Sanity Test ***************

Suppose a website has five pages and each pages hase some images, links, buttons, products etc.
Here in every release of each page we can run the smokee/sanity test and only check does 
the page loads properly or not. Are images, button ok or not. Do we have right amount of 
product or not.

Here will not test those functions in details.
