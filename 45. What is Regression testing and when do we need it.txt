*********** What is Regression testing and when do we need it ************
Regression testing is re-running functional and non-functional tests to ensure that 
previously developed and tested software still performs as expected after a change.


When a new features has updated or any bug has fixed, we run it test and also
have to test all other features to be confirmed that this new update didn't put any 
impact to the other features. The existing application still works the new changes.


Automation testing majorly does regression testing cause it's need much time to test all.
Recommended before every release.
