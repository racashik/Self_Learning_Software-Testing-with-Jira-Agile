*************** What is Kan ban Board in Agile *************
Kan Ban Board has no "Sprint", it only has the project deadline. Here all the task show in the Backlog list/to do list, 
Team will pick and finish one by one which one they prefer to begin. 


Kan Ban Board = Scrum - Sprint 

So KanBan Board has everything except "Sprint", which has in "Scrum" board.



But 80% use "Scrum" Board and 20% use "KanBan" Board so better to go with "Scrum" Board always.
